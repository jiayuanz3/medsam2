Medical SAM 2, or say MedSAM-2, is an advanced segmentation model that utilizes the [SAM 2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything-2) framework to address both 2D and 3D medical
image segmentation tasks. This method is elaborated on the paper [Medical SAM 2: Segment Medical Images As Video Via Segment Anything Model 2](...).

**We will release the code for both 2D and 3D medical images in the following weeks.**
